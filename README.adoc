== Introduction

In this demo we'll take a look at how we can use Spring GraphQL in our Java applications.
GraphQL is a query language (hence the QL) that in conjunction with a framework such as `Spring GraphQL` can be used to efficiently manage our data, and even reuse existing services.

It has 2 core concepts:

. queries: used for to define which data should be fetched, and which fields thereof should be included
. mutations: used to manage our dataset
