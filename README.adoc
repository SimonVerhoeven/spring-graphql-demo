== Introduction

In this demo we'll take a look at how we can use Spring GraphQL in our Java applications.
GraphQL is a query language (hence the QL) that in conjunction with a framework such as `Spring GraphQL` can be used to efficiently manage our data, and even reuse existing services.

It has 2 core concepts:

. queries: used for to define which data should be fetched, and which fields thereof should be included
. mutations: used to manage our dataset

It's an alternative to REST, SOAP, or gRPC, and supports calls over HTTP, WebSocket and RSocket.

Feel free to check out the code from this repository, to more easily follow along.

== Setup

To get started we just need the following dependencies in our pom.xml:

[code,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.graphql</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-graphql-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
We're using Spring MVC here, but we could also use websocket/webflux/rsocket here (see for reference: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web.graphql[possible starters])
====

We'll also be enabling the graphical interactive GraphQL IDE (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL]), by adding:
[code]
----
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true
----

to our `application.properties`.

This allows us to easily interact with & develop GraphQL APIs.

== (Dis)advantages

GraphQL has its advantages, and disadvantages over REST, and one can even use both in the sample application.

Advantages:

* flexible: the client can specify the required fields
* higher decoupling from API changes
* less expensive operations (reduced payload size, and data can be aggregated so less round trips)
* high discoverability given the APIs are introspectable, so clients can query the schema to find the available types & fields
* real-time data using subscriptions, without the need for polling

Disadvantages:

* no native file upload support
* no native support for web caching
* harder to cache given its flexible nature
* the flexible nature can also lead to complexity in managing the schema, and efficient query resolution

In case of data flexibility is needed/over-under-fetching is an issue/real time data is needed/mobile use-cases GraphQL is a good fit.
However, if the data structure is stable, caching is critical, resource-based models or simple CRUD calls there's certainly nothing wrong with rest.

At the end of the day you need to evaluate which fits your use-cases the best, and maybe even use a mix of both.

== Extra

Whilst the GraphQL protocol is focused on textual data, there is the informal https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec[graphql-multipart-request-spec] which allows file upload over HTTP. Keep in mind that this does lead to certain issues as documented on the https://www.apollographql.com/blog/backend/file-uploads/file-upload-best-practices/[Appolo GraphQL blog]. If you would like to use the spec in your application you can do so using: https://github.com/nkonev/multipart-spring-graphql[multipart-spring-graphql]
